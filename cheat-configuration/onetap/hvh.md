# HvH

**Configurating the cheat**

First off you're gonna have to select the weapon / weapons of your choice when HvH-ing \(SSG-08, SCAR-20, G3SG1, AWP, R8, Deagle, etc\). These weapons are the most common in HvH because of accuracy, damage, and oneshot potiential. So now you have a weapon in mind what settings do you need?

## Features

First before you start trying to config your cheat you should know what features your cheat has and what they do. We will start with the general tab under rage.

### General

The first thing you're gonna see is _enabled_ this is the button that will activate the ragebot. If you right click it you will see options such as _none_, _toggle_, _hold_, and _always_. If you're HvH-ing your gonna want this to be always on.

* Pitch resolver This feature is mainly used for nospread HvH for when other pitches might be present.
* Silent This is for local view only, but it will not snap to targets on your screen. Spectators and overtwatchers will still see you snapping.
* Team check This will make the aimbot check to see if there is a teammate that might get shot when shooting an enemy.
* Auto scope This will automatically scope for you letting you know your aimbot has / had a shot on an enemy.
* Resolver override It will override your resolver turning it off so you can manually shoot someone if you know where their real is.
* Force body aim Will force the aimbot to only shoot body.
* Force safepoint Will force the cheat to shoot safepoints only. \(_Safepoints where the real and fake meet. So it pretty much guarantees a hit_\)

### Exploits

* Hideshots This is an exploit that prevents you from getting onshotted, by tickbase manipulation.
* Doubletap Another exploit that uses tickbase manipulation. It will fire two shots in a time it would normally take one shot

### Targeting

* Fov The field of view of the rage bot.
* Minimum damage The minimum damage for the ragebot to shoot a target. If minimum damage is set to 50 the ragebot will not shoot unless the player can atleast be hit for 50 damage.
* Hitboxes The hitboxes the ragebot will aim for on the player.
* Multipoint hitboxes Multiplepoint hitbox adds a certain amount of points on the edges of hitboxes to hit edgers / boxers easier.

### Accuracy

* Hitchance This is the % the ragebot will shoot your minimum damage at. Say you have 100% hitchance with 1 minimum damage, the ragebot will not shoot unless it has a 100% chance of hittting the enemy for 1 damage.
* Autostop Automatically reduces speed to obtain higher accuracy when someone is being targeted.
* Prefer safepoint Make the ragebot prefer safepoint conditions.
* Prefer body aim Make the ragebot prefer body aim conditions

## Making a config
