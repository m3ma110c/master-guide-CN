# Blatant

Semi raging is when a person goes as blatantly as possible while trying to hide from overwatch. In most cases players end up using a trigger bot on a fairly low delay and high FOV with low smoothing on their legit bot. Although some players choose to use the ragebot on key \(Mouse 1\) with a low FOV, this style of semi raging is mostly used when playing against other semi ragers in a "legit" HvH game.

The basics to semi rage with aimware are the following:

Always use legit AA. When using a legit bot to semi rage, use high FOV with low smoothing and a fairly low delay trigger bot. When using a rage bot to semi rage, use low FOV and set the rage bot to shoot on key.
