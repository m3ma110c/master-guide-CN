# Introduction

Nowdays there are a lot of functions in cheats for CSGO, and it will take time to set up the cheat from sratch everytime. Therefore configuration files \(configs\) are born. They are designed to reduce the time setting up configuration, while just loading up as a single file.

In the section, you will going to learn about:

* Setting up different configurations for various playstyle \(legit, rage, semirage...\), and explaining the concepts on configs.
* Know more about paid configs

## Concepts

### Legit/Closet cheating

The critical thing for legit cheating is trying to convince from your teammates, enemy and overwatchers that your are a legit player. Thus obviously you won't see rage features activated \(i.e 180 aimbot, yaw anti-aim etc.\). Instead, we will focused on making our aimbots more "humanized", whihc makes the cheat to slowly drag the crosshair to the target player's desired body position.

Also in most situation, we would like to let the aimbot to aim for the body first, whihc makes it look convincing. As for players who had a hard time to controlling recoil, the RCS would also be their interested feature to setup.

Finally for movements and miscallaneous, this is down to personal's perference. To start with, all "zhun wanna-bes" must priortize on making their strafing features looks like a professional bhop player. Plus, gernade spot helper would also be useful for you to throw some insane gernades.

### Semirage

In fact, the defination of the term "semirage" actually varies in different player. However at here, we would define "semirage" as "Disable yaw anti-aim in rage anti-aim mode, use rage aimbot without getting triggered by VACnet". In fact, it makes semirage as "rage mode without yaw anti-aim". In this mode, you focus would be in anti-aims and rage aimbot.

For rage aimbot, it is recommend that the target fov would be no higher that 30 degrees fov. And features like dymanic fov is also recommend to be enable when semiraging, which is useful when targeting enemy from different distances. The autowall inside rage aimbot is also our focus, too. Usually, autowalls should be set to "legit" \(Shooting through walls that legit players could also do\). This is usually achieved by scripts.

Regarding weapon targeting, usually the minium damage of different will be set to each weapon's default minium damage to the torso, which could be find at [here](https://csgo-stats.com/weapons).

You are being warned that setting the minium damage too low would makes the aimbot to shoot too early, which makes you cannot damage the emeny player effectivly, and you will getting in "on-shot" state. The "on-shot" state will makes other cheat to be able to caught the position of your playermodel's head as when your player is shooting, there is no anti-aim enabled. While vice versa will makes your cheat seldom will shoot as it is hard to match the high minium damage confition. In all here's the general concept for most of the weapons you would used in hvh:

* AWP: Usually the minium would be set to 85. This would allow most cheat to gave a lethal shot to the emeny player. However if the cheat misses too much on giving the lethal shot, it is recommended to make the minium damage to HP+1 \(101 damage\) ~ HP+3 \(103 damage\).
* AUTOs: It depends on which gamemode and your playstyle \(matchmaking/community hvh server?, semirage/rage?\) In general, setting the minium damage to 50~55 would be an ideal value, as it could be applied in both matchmaking and community hvh.
* Scout: The general idea of scout is set it's minium damage to around 75 or above, however in matchmaking, if there is only one cheater, you can take the risk by setting the minium damage to HP+1 \(101 damage\), to catch the emeny's "on-shot" state for the most lethal shot. However this would let you having the chance to take some damage. So please use it wisely.
* Pistols: It depends on which pistol you're using. For deage/revlovers, the damage would usually set to as close to scout's general minium damage \(75 damage\). While for dual brettas, it is recommend to set the minium damage to 25 damage.

Despite the discourage of setting the minium damage too low, it is still recommend that having features like minium-damage oevrride standby, with minium damage would be set to a very low value \(5~25 damage\). This is useful when you're holding spots that only few damages could be made, thus it could slowly hurting the enemy player to death.

### Hitchance

Hitchances are the chances of one shot hitting the enemy plyer when firing bullets. The general idea for one-shot weapons to set their hitchance 75% or above, and auto weapons would be slight lower to around 65%.

### Rage

Rage cheating would share the same roots with semirage, while making improvements on anti-aim. // TODO
