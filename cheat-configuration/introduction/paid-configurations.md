# Paid configurations

You may see lot's of famous youtubers are dominating in every hvh match, while you only barely killing a player. Then theese youtubers told you to join their membership to get access to their configs. You instantly join their membership, download their config, try it out... And nothing changed. You're still gettting killed by other players, with yourself still wondering "How am I still doing badly, even though I am using their config?"

## Configs don't represent the whole picture

A good config can help you to get more kills, but the most important thing is your playstyle. You need both to to dominate a match. Also, there is the sad truth that you may not be using the same config as the youtubers are using themselves, which means they might be selling a fake config. Even if they are selling the same config as they show in their videos, you still have the chance that it might not suit your playstyle, because its made for their own playstyle and not yours.

## Scripts

As more cheats developers supports scripting to extend the behaviour of their product, there are a lot of scripts that is paid, while some don't. There is no denying there are some scripts that actually could ehance the experience when using the cheat, like semirage scripts \(which is missing in some cheats\), griefing scripts \(fake votes, blockbot\) or movement scripts. However there are a lot of useless scripts on the market that are paid or free to take. These scripts will simply wasting your time on using it. In short, it is recommend to avoid scripts like:

* Anti-aim scripts: This is a little bit conterversal as some scripts would actually useful, however in fact most of them are useless as desync anti-aims are very limited. Also for newcomers, you will be disappointed that using a anti-aim scripts won't make you become a god instantly, as it is also tied to playstyle. In short, if you don't know how you can set-up these anti-aim scripts, don't buy it.
* "HvH essentials" scripts: A lot of people will stacking up different essential scripts to hope for a best performance. Which is kinda useless as they are being limited by the cheat they are running on. In short, when getting these scripts you should take a look at:
  * Minium damage override
  * Matchmaking fakeduck
  * //TODO

If your cheat is missing the features above, then you should take at least one of these scripts.

* Reslover scripts: Straightforward blatant scam. There is no way to 100% reslove desync anti-aims. Also in the cheat itself, you can both force body-aim a player, or trying to reslover override. \(That said there is still no gurantee you will able to kill the enemy player.\)

## Leaked Configs

It's inevitable that youtubers configs get leaked and if you know where to look you can find almost any youtubers config you want. A good place to start is by looking at leaking websites and the cheat forums themselves, there are a ton of good congifs for free on the forums. Some may be over hyped in the title, like they always are, but doesnt hurt to try them.

Here are some examples of config-leaking websites:

* [Matt1's leaked configuration collection](https://old.reddit.com/r/Csgohacks/comments/f1wdlb/freak_config_pack_reuploaded/)
* [Teeesense.xyz](https://teeesense.xyz/forums/)
* [Streetwits.xyz](https://streetwits.xyz/forums/)
* hentaiware.moe

* [horrid.pw](https://horrid.pw/)
* [clowned.cc](https://forum.clowned.cc/)
* failure.website
* [spamtec.cc](http://spamtec.cc/)

Some of the aformentioned websites are invite only sadly, but in the end almost all the websites have the same leaked configs.
