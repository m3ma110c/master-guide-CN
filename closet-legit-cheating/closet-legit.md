# Closet? Legit?

A lot of newcomers get confused about the difference between a closet cheater and a legit cheater. A closet cheater plays with overy little features on \(see below\). These cheaters are very hard to detect due to the use of very subtle settings in a game compared to legit cheaters. A legit cheater is a bit easier to detect ingame due to certain factors. They are usually given away by their backtracking or the shots they are hitting. They tend to use a much bigger variety of features compared to closet cheaters \(see below\).

## Closet Cheating

* Nade Helper
* No ESP
* Miniture aimbot assist
* No RCS-Little RCS
* A low value of triggerbot + backtracking \(even none\)

## Legit cheating

* Low-Medium aimbot assist
* RCS
* A high value of triggerbot + backtracking
* Movement settings such as: Bhops, Auto-Strafe \(Less common ones are\): Edgebug, Edgejump and a Movement recorder
* ESP
* Nade Helper
