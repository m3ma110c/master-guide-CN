## Legit HvH

Legit HvH, or commonly known as semi-raging, is when two players toggle on their cheats to their full potential, while still trying to avoid an Overwatch ban. This usually consists of the players having legit anti-aim instead of full on rage anti-aim.

--todo--

Semiragers have to make sure to make good use of grenades, e.g. They prefer to use HE grenades the most to lower their opponents hp then Molotov's and smoke grenades come next to block a push or to allow a push to continue by smoking off a molotov.
