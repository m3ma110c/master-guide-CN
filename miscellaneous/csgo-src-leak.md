# CSGO Source Code leaks

In 22nd April 2020, a copy of CSGO's incomplete source code has been leaked into 4chan's page within Team Fortress 2's source code, a project that Tyler Mcvicker [\(A.K.A, Valve News Network\)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL5RKbiAPqSC_mUIjCpx3xg)'s studio has been working on, and some images leading about Half-Life 3. \(Which is mostly public.\). Within hours, copies are being made across most popular cheating forums and mirrors are made on github and MEGA cloud. Despite valve took action immediately and serval mirrors are taken down, a lot of people have obtained the source code.

## Am I safe from this source code leak?

At the beginning of the leak, there are serval claimed that cathook, a Team Fortess 2 cheat for linux has successfully found a RCE \(Remote command exection\) exploit that allows the attacker to execute files to the victim's PC. However it turns out the videos are faked and the administrators of Cathook has clarified theese videos are not afficiated with cathook, there are still rumors that the is RCE exploits around for both games. Later that day, the developers of CSGO made a tweet to clarify there are no exploits are being undiscorved inside the leaked source code, as some CSGO reverse engineers have confirmed Valve's statement. So it's pretty sure to say that you're safe to play CSGO.
