# Ratpoison

-- Link: [https://github.com/TheFuckingRat/RatPoison/](https://github.com/TheFuckingRat/RatPoison/) Download zip, unzip it, run build.bat and type Y or N depending on whether you have the JDK \(not the JRE\). It will handle installing the JDK for you, then build the cheat. The cheat will then be in the /build/Ratpoison \(version number\)/ folder. Open CSGO, then run the bat file. It is an external, but it binds to the csgo.exe window so the menu shows up on top. Also, the default menu key is F1. Do not ask for a legit config. It is not difficult to create one yourself, not to mention everyone's idea of "legit" and what they personally want on and off in each cheat changes.

Ratpoison is an external legit cheat that was forked from charlatano\(Which also is a great external cheat that hasn't been detected for a long time.\), written in Java. It hasn't been detected for 3 years, and it's source is available on Github. It is highly recommended to newcomers who don't have programming experience.

## Prerequisites

* Windows 7 or above \(Overlay is only available on Windows 10\)
* \(Optional\) Java Development Kit 13 [How to install JDK 13?](https://tubemint.com/install-java-jdk/)

## How to set up

Head over to [their Github repository](https://github.com/TheFuckingRat/RatPoison/)

Click on "Clone or Download", then in the drop-down window, click download as zip. ![ratpdownload](https://prnt.sc/t3w2q0)

After you downloaded the zip file, unzip to a random folder, but we recommend that folder name should not have:

* spaces
* symbols that don't exist in ASCII table \(No random words\)

After you unzip it, you should be able to see the folder structure like this: \[TODO:Inject photos\]

Click on build.bat. \[TODO:Inject photos\]

After you click on build.bat, a command prompt window will show up, and ask if you have the JDK installed. Type Y or N depending on whether you have the JDK \(not the JRE\). It will handle installing the JDK for you, then compile the cheat. \[TODO:Inject photos\]

The cheat will then be in the \build\Ratpoison \(version number\) folder. \[TODO:Inject photos\]

After you compiled the cheat, you need to run CSGO first, then run the .bat file inside the output folder mentioned above.

Since it is an external, but it binds to the csgo.exe the menu shows up on top. Also, the default menu key is F1. \[TODO:Inject photos\]

We recommend to load into this map [Aim Botz](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=243702660) and try to mess around with the settings, until you find the best legit config that works best for you. If you can't set it up, we will make a basic legit config in a later section.
